I added a package.json file and added type / modules to it

 and in the html added type modules in the src link for the js file.

To get it to accept the export and import it works for me with out having a bundler involved

to get the img src link to render I add to the end after the png file type. ?raw=true

I found this googeling when I could not get my GitHub image links to render I use GitHub pages to hoist from and test.

Adding it just works .....see video link

I used your supplied code and it flows along with the time stamps you will notice I have not even gotten to the animation yet, any code after 16 or more minutes. Before it gets weird??
